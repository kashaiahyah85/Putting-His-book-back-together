It is warned in 2 Peter 3:

    "Beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
    and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
    count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that
    all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
    the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with
    fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up. Then all these
    things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in holy conversation and in
    godliness, Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being
    on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
    
    Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein
    dwelleth righteousness. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent
    that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless. And account that the 
    longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the
    wisdom given unto him hath written unto you; _As also in his epistles, speaking in them of
    these things; in which are some things hard to be understood_, which they that are uneducated
    and not comprehending, _as they do also the other scriptures_, unto their own destruction.
    
    Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led 
    away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. But grow in grace, and
    in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. 
    Amen.

Because of this, it would be good if we made efforts to understand what he is warning of, and how
to be able to comprehend the later writings of Paul. He wrote with a heavy presumption that his
audience would be educated Jews who knew the Torah. Given that churches today in Christiandom
seem to think Paul was disowning the Torah, and that they should too, they ensure the error lives
on in the church forever by their traditions inherited by misunderstandings. Knowing what of the
Torah Paul was making reference to in his writings sheds light on the meanings, as he very often
would quote or paraphrase Torah writings thinking that you would already know enough to recognize,
forgoing the mentioning of quotation. I myself carry that same thing, and so did jesus as is 
shown elsewhere in this body of writings. Yes; despite global teachings to the contrary; the
churches are wrong about Sin, God, Love, and all other things.

In this set of writings, I aim to show to you that it is well worth your efforts to understand,
and to comprehend. You will then be able and open to a seeing of connected scriptures, and how it
is possible to understand what is said to be mystery. This is more than a commentary, in that I
am only showing you the methods and my own seeing of these things, from My own eyes. This, for
your own situation, is the beginning of either a great spiritual quest, or just another ARG. This,
I will leave wholly to the reader to discover.
